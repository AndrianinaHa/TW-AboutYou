                    I live in Madagascar, precisely in Antananarivo.<br>
                    My country is very famous, most likely because of the Madagascar movie with the lemur and penguins.<br>
                    But it's famous for other things too like the production of Vanilla, CVO+,...<br>
                    You will be able to find different beautiful places made for you to go on holidays. One of them is in Toamasina where many historical events happened.<br>
                    And Toamasina is where I was born too so I hope you visit the place.

                    I learn Computer Science at ISPM, a renown college in my country and I'm on my third year now.<br>
                    This year, we're planning to make a video game with our group of 5 people.

                    I like playing musical instruments : piano and guitar <br>
                    But cooking is what I like the most because you can make whatever you want to eat and it would still look good even if it's burnt.<br>
                    That aside, I read a lot. Science fiction, fantasy, Comedy, Romance, there are so many to watch that before I realize, I've read a book already.
